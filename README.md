Radio Player, is a simple extension that can play online radio right in your browser.

It has a list of more than 24k radio channels. Simply select the country of your choice and then select a desired channel from the right list. The radio will start to play automatically after loading is completed.

Note 1: some radio channels may not work properly. In case of any errors happening, please select a different channel and try again. You can pause the current radio or change the volume from the radio player in the UI. All changes are auto-saved to the memory in this add-on.

Note 2: All the radio database is located locally on your machine. However, when you choose a station to play, the add-on fetches the audio data and image related to that station from the internet.
